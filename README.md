**Four billion people** — Four billion people — almost two thirds of the world's population — experience severe water scarcity for at least one month each year. Over two billion people live in countries where water supply is inadequate. Half of the world's population could be living in areas facing water scarcity by as early as 2025.[^1]

This project aims to use Machine Learning tools and geographic datasets to determine the most cost effective locations to drill with highest probability of finding water.
